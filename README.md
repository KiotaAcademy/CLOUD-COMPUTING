# CLOUD COMPUTING

cloud computing stores and processes information over the Internet instead of on a computer's hard drive.

Why do this? Because by sharing online computing resources rather than relying on local storage and computers, the cloud can accomplish two things:

1. It can store and process much larger amounts of information a lot faster.
2. It can deliver results to any device that can log onto the Internet, not just one phone, tablet, computer, or set of local terminals.

You work with cloud services every day, whenever you access providers or services, such as 

1. Netflix
2. Dropbox
3. Microsoft Office Online
4. iTunes

The data still gets stored in hardware. But that hardware might have left the building. It can take two forms:

1. Physical server
2. Virtual server - one physical server into a number of virtual servers
